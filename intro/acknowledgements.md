# Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the help of many people. First thanks must go to Professor Brandon Ogbunu. The initial conception of this book was built from a course Charlotte designed with him in Spring 2019. Without his feedback and support, we would not have turned a small final project idea into a completed 'book'. Thanks also to the researchers whose work we drew on for the examples used in this project, especially Stephen Strogatz, Jeff Gore, and the late Donella Meadows.
